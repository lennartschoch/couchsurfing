# Couchsurfing
So IKEA released this font called Soffa (or Vallentuna) Sans, which entirely consists of couches. While companies are catching up on using this font on their websites, you can take a shortcut and use this Chrome plugin, which just changes every font on the internet to this amazing piece of art.

## Installation

1. Download / clone the repository
1. In Chrome, naviate to chrome://extensions and enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
1. Click "Load unpacked" and select the root directory of the repository
1. Enjoy a better internet

**Note: Due to copyright reasons, you"ll need to install the font from [here](https://rabbitholetestorch001.blob.core.windows.net/plugins/SOFFA-VALLENTUNA/IKEA-SOFFA-VALLENTUNA-Sans.zip) before you can use the plugin.**
